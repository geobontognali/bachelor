In a world where everything moves forward at the speed of light, home building technology is also not excluded from this rapid development. 
\\
Today, plenty of systems are built into new homes. One of them is the intercom. 
\\
\\
During our bachelor thesis, we developed a prototype for an intercom, based on open source software and hardware components. One of the aims of this project was to evaluate and proof the ability of such components to handle this kind of application. 
\\
During the design phase, many different requirements were defined. The intercom needed to be able to provide an audio and video stream. Nowadays, everyone is always connected to the internet, thanks to the power of modern communication systems like Tablets and Smartphones. So, there was no doubt about the need of the intercom to be fully digital. As soon as things like digital real-time video- and audio transmissions come on the table, also a lot of different complications and challenges come with them, too. 
\\
\\
As a result, we came up with a prototype that provides a flexible, up-to-date, and reasonably inexpensive solution for a modern house intercom system.
